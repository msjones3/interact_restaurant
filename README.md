# interact_restaurant
Use python to interact with the restaurant DB
Please note that you will need to have the restaurant DB downloaded and in the parent file for this to work.

## Before running this code
It is very important for you to understand this code before running it. 

Annotate sections of the code to show your understanding of what it does! 
- How does one connect to the database?
- Where are the SQL statements? 
- What are the placeholders for? 
- Why did the creator of this code decide to write the changes to the database in a TRY block?
- What does the db.commit() statement do? 
- What are the differences and similarities between the 3 files?

Finally, once you feel like you have a pretty good idea of how it should work, go ahead and run it. Then, feel free to modify the code to create something useful.
